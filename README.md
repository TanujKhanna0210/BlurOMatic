# Blur-O-Matic
An app that blurs photos and saves the result to a file.  
The screen has radio buttons where you can select how blurry you'd like your image to be. Pressing the Go button will eventually blur and save the image.  

The app uses __WorkManager__ to show status notifications and blur the image in the background.
